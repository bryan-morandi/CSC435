**NOTE: My comments will always start with ** so you can differentiate the console output and my comments.

** This output will show the interleving of requests and how the jokes/proverbs first start out in order
** but after the first cycle is complete (When "JOKE MODE COMPLETED" or "PROVERB MODE COMPLETED" is displayed)
** then the jokes/proverbs will be output in a random order. 
** Note that (J/A)W-X-Y-Z labels will always be in order because I added some additional functionality, so this can be
** ignored, the (J/A)W-X-Y-Z labels will show the randomness of the jokes/proverbs, they will just appear before 
** the jokes/proverbs output, not before the users name.

Note to grader: I added some functionality to the joke/proverb labels, the initial label will be W through X and will always be in order even after shuffling. I still have included the required A through D labels and they will be randomized with the jokes, but I placed them after the username prepending the joke. I wanted to add additional complexity to show that the jokes can be randomized while still keeping the label order consistent.
